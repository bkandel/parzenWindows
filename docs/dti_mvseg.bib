	abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is topologically equivalent to a sheet and can be considered topologically spherical if it is closed at the brain stem. Low-level segmentation of magnetic resonance {(MR)} imagery typically produces cerebral volumes whose tessellations are not topologically spherical. We present a novel algorithm that analyzes and constrains the topology of a volumetric object. Graphs are formed that represent the connectivity of voxel segments in the foreground and background of the image. These graphs are analyzed and minimal corrections to the volume are made prior to tessellation. We apply the algorithm to a simple test object and to cerebral white matter masks generated by a low-level tissue identification sequence. We tessellate the resulting objects using the marching cubes algorithm and verify their topology by computing their Euler characteristics. A key benefit of the algorithm is that it localizes the change to a volume to the specific areas of its topological defects.},

	abstract = {Joint tissues are exquisitely sensitive to their mechanical environment, and mechanical loading may be the most important external factor regulating the development and long-term maintenance of joint tissues. Moderate mechanical loading maintains the integrity of articular cartilage; however, both disuse and overuse can result in cartilage degradation. The irreversible destruction of cartilage is the hallmark of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In these instances of cartilage breakdown, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases {(MMPs)} and aggrecanases {(ADAMTSs)}, enzymes that can degrade components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. In order to prevent cartilage destruction, tremendous effort has been expended to design inhibitors of {MMP/ADAMTS} activity and/or synthesis. To date, however, no effective clinical inhibitors exist. Accumulating evidence suggests that physiologic joint loading helps maintain cartilage integrity; however, the mechanisms by which these mechanical stimuli regulate joint homeostasis are still being elucidated. Identifying mechanosensitive chondroprotective pathways may reveal novel targets or therapeutic strategies in preventing cartilage destruction in joint disease.},

	abstract = {The mitochondrion is at the core of cellular energy metabolism, being the site of most {ATP} generation. Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and acts at several levels within the organelle to stimulate {ATP} synthesis. However, the dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis is now recognized to play a key role in several pathologies. For example, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) overload can lead to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering of the permeability transition pore, and cytochrome c release, leading to apoptosis. Despite progress regarding the independent roles of both Ca(2+) and mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the molecular mechanisms by which Ca(2+) can elicit mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. This review highlights the delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of Ca(2+) and the signaling events that perturb this balance. Overall, a "two-hit" hypothesis is developed, in which Ca(2+) plus another pathological stimulus can bring about mitochondrial dysfunction.},

	abstract = {We studied the local viscoelasticity of the apical membrane of human umbilical vein endothelial cells within confluent layers by magnetic tweezers microrheometry. Magnetic beads are coupled to various integrins by coating with fibronectin or invasin. By analyzing the deflection of beads evoked by various force scenarios we demonstrate that the cell envelope behaves as a linear viscoelastic body if forces up to 2 {nN} are applied for short times ({\textless}20 s) but can respond in an adaptive way if stress pulses are applied longer ({\textgreater}30 s). The time-dependent shear relaxation modulus G(t) exhibits three time regimes: a fast response (t {\textless} 0.05 s) where the relaxation modulus G(t) obeys a power law G(t) approximately t(-0.82+/-0.02); a plateau-like behavior (at 0.05 s {\textless} t {\textless} 0.15 s); and a slow flow-like response which is, however, partially reversible. Strain field mapping experiments with colloidal probes show that local forces induce a strain field exhibiting a range of zeta = 10 +/- 1 microm, but which could only be observed if nonmagnetic beads were coupled to the cell surface by invasin. By application of the theory of elasticity of planar bodies we estimated a surface shear modulus of 2.5 x10(-4) N/m. By assuming a thickness of the actin cortex of approximately 0.5 microm we estimate a Young modulus micro approximately 400 Pa for the apical membrane. The value agrees with a plateau modulus of an entangled or weakly cross-linked actin network of an actin concentration of 100 {microM} (mesh size 0.2 microm). This result together with our observation of a strong reduction of the shear modulus by the actin destabilizing agent latrunculin A suggests that the shear modulus measured by our technique is determined by the actin cortex. The effect of two ligands inducing actin stress fiber formation and centripetal contraction of cells (associated with the formation of gaps in the confluent cell monolayer) on the viscoelastic responses were studied: histamine and lysophosphatidic acid {(LPA).} Histamine evoked a dramatic increase of the cell stiffness by {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude within {\textless}30 s, which is attributed to a transient rise of the intracellular Ca(2+) level, since {DMSO} exerted a similar effect. The stiffening is accompanied by a concomitant rounding of the cells as observed by microinterferometry and relaxes partially in the timescale of 5 min, whereas gaps between cells close after approximately 30 min. {LPA} did not exert a remarkable and reproducible effect other than an occasional very weak transient increase of the shear stiffness, which shows that the gap formation activated by {LPA} is mediated by a different mechanism than that induced by histamine.},

	abstract = {Nanomaterials have become increasingly important in the development of new molecular probes for in vivo imaging, both experimentally and clinically. Nanoparticulate imaging probes have included semiconductor quantum dots, magnetic and magnetofluorescent nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles and nanoshells, among others. However, the use of nanomaterials for one of the most common imaging techniques, computed tomography {(CT)}, has remained unexplored. Current {CT} contrast agents are based on small iodinated molecules. They are effective in absorbing X-rays, but non-specific distribution and rapid pharmacokinetics have rather limited their microvascular and targeting performance. Here we propose the use of a polymer-coated {Bi(2)S(3)} nanoparticle preparation as an injectable {CT} imaging agent. This preparation demonstrates excellent stability at high concentrations (0.25 M Bi(3+)), high X-ray absorption (fivefold better than iodine), very long circulation times ({\textgreater}2 h) in vivo and an efficacy/safety profile comparable to or better than iodinated imaging agents. We show the utility of these polymer-coated {Bi(2)S(3)} nanoparticles for enhanced in vivo imaging of the vasculature, the liver and lymph nodes in mice. These nanoparticles and their bioconjugates are expected to become an important adjunct to in vivo imaging of molecular targets and pathological conditions.},

The simplest voxel-based method and 2 widely used subvoxel approaches are illustrated first, together with brief notes on parameter selection and the restrictions arising from the distinct attributes of tract estimations. Subsequently, some advanced techniques attempting to offer improvement in various aspects are briefly introduced, including the increasingly popular research tracking tool using {HARDI.} The article explains the inherent technical limitations in most of the algorithms reported to date and concludes by providing a reference guideline for formulating routine applications of this important tool to clinical neuroradiology in an objective and reproducible manner.},

	abstract = {Disturbances in vascular function contribute to the development of several diseases of increasing prevalence and thereby contribute significantly to human mortality and morbidity. Atherosclerosis, diabetes, heart failure, and ischemia with attendant reperfusion injury share many of the same risk factors, among the most important being oxidative stress and alterations in the blood concentrations of compounds that influence oxidative stress, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In this review, we focus on endothelial cells: cells in the frontline against these disturbances. Because {ATP} supplies in endothelial cells are relatively independent of mitochondrial oxidative pathways, the mitochondria of endothelial cells have been somewhat neglected. However, they are emerging as agents with diverse roles in modulating the dynamics of intracellular calcium and the generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. The mitochondria may also constitute critical "targets" of oxidative stress, because survival of endothelial cells can be compromised by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or by mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. In addition, evidence suggests that endothelial mitochondria may play a "reconnaissance" role. For example, although the exact mechanism remains obscure, endothelial mitochondria may sense levels of oxygen in the blood and relay this information to cardiac myocytes as well as modulating the vasodilatory response mediated by endothelial nitric oxide.},

	abstract = {While a pathway for Ca2+ accumulation into mitochondria has long been established, its functional significance is only now becoming clear in relation to cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological Ca2+ signalling in a variety of cell types leads to four questions: (i) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?' (ii) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ signalling?' (iii) {'What} are the consequences of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for cell function?' and finally (iv) {'What} are the consequences of pathological {[Ca2+]c} signalling for mitochondrial function?' These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i) accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria regulates mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential. (ii) Mitochondria may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in many cells, regulating the local Ca2+ concentration in cellular microdomains. This process regulates processes dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration {([Ca2+]c)}, particularly the flux of Ca2+ through {IP3-gated} channels of the endoplasmic reticulum {(ER)} and the channels mediating capacitative Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Consequently, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in shaping {[Ca2+]c} signals in many cell types. (iii) Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters the spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular {[Ca2+]c} signalling and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism. (iv) Under pathological conditions of cellular {[Ca2+]c} overload, particularly in association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger pathological states that lead to cell death. In the model of glutamate excitotoxicity, microdomains of {[Ca2+]c} are apparently central, as the pathway to cell death seems to require the local activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase {(nNOS)}, itself held by scaffolding proteins in close association with the {NMDA} receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in combination with {NO} production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell death.},

In this study we show how mechanical stress perturbs the intracellular structures of the cell and induces mechanical responses. In order to correlate mechanical perturbations to cellular responses, we used a combined fluorescence-atomic force microscope {(AFM)} to produce well defined nanomechanical perturbations of 10 {nN} while simultaneously tracking the real-time motion of fluorescently labelled mitochondria in live cells. The spatial displacement of the organelles in response to applied loads demonstrates the highly dynamic mechanical response of mitochondria in fibroblast cells. The average displacement of all mitochondrial structures analysed showed an increase of approximately 40\%, post-perturbation ( approximately 160 nm in comparison to basal displacements of approximately 110 nm). These results show that local forces can produce organelle displacements at locations far from the initial point of contact (up to approximately 40 microm). In order to examine the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission and its effect on mitochondrial displacements, both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton were disrupted using Cytochalasin D and Nocodazole, respectively. Our results show that there is no significant change in mitochondrial displacement following indentation after such treatments. These results demonstrate the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission through the cell and on mitochondrial displacements. In addition, it is suggested that care must be taken when performing mechanical experiments on living cells with the {AFM}, as these local mechanical perturbations may have significant structural and even biochemical effects on the cell.},

Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e.g. those based on {fuzzy-C-means} {(FCM)}, incorporate Gaussian class models which are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters. Fiber bundles in {DT} images, however, comprise tensors that can inherently lie on more-complex manifolds. Unlike {FCM-based} schemes, the proposed method relies on modeling the manifolds underlying the classes by incorporating nonparametric data-driven statistical models. It produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework. For {DT} images, the paper describes a consistent statistical technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian {DT} spaces that incorporates two very recent works. In this way, the proposed method provides uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity. The paper shows results on synthetic and real, {DT} as well as {MR} images.},

	abstract = {Intravascular iodinated contrast agents are required for a large proportion of computed tomography {(CT)} studies. Contrast media are indispensable to more clearly differentiate anatomic structures and to detect and characterize abnormalities. Depending on the indication up to 200 ml of these agents are injected during {CT.} Despite these large amounts adverse effects are rare and have further decreased with the introduction of non-ionic substances. However, it took 10 to 20 years until these non-ionic agents replaced the older ionic agents in clinical practice. In recent years no new substance has been brought to the market. The introduction of rapid scanning using multislice {CT} technology, however, has led to the development of more sophisticated contrast injection techniques. Current research focuses on optimizing contrast application techniques and on further evaluating the safety profiles of the various substances. The amount of contrast enhancement obtained in individual patients for instance depends on the contrast agent characteristics, such as iodine concentration, and the parameters of the contrast injection protocol, such as iodine flux and iodine dose. Meanwhile, contrast agent characteristics such as osmolality and viscosity play a role in the safety profile of an agent. This paper provides a current overview of {CT} contrast media, {CT} contrast dynamics, and {CT} contrast applications with a special focus on oncological imaging.},

	abstract = {Highly accurate surface models of the cerebral cortex are becoming increasingly important as tools in the investigation of the functional organization of the human brain. The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} This prospective study employs anisotropic diffusion-weighted {(ADW)} magnetic resonance imaging for the integration of individual spatial information concerning the principal motor pathways into the operating room during microneurosurgery in the central region. We hypothesize that the three-dimensional {(3-D)} visualization of the pyramidal tract position {(PTV)} in a neuronavigation system based on {ADW} provides valid information concerning the position and extension of the principal motor pathways. {METHODS} A total of 13 consecutive patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal tracts and the central region underwent microneurosurgery with the help of pyramidal tract visualization {(PTV).} An {ADW} sequence obtained preoperatively was fused to an anatomic navigation sequence. The {3-D} reconstructions of the precentral gyrus {(PG)}, the pyramidal tract, and the tumor were available in a customized neuronavigation system during surgery. Intraoperatively the {PG} was identified on the basis of the aforementioned data. Electric motorcortex stimulation {(CS)} was used to directly verify the {PG} location and indirectly the fiber tract position. {RESULTS} In 11 cases (92\%) the prediction of the principal motor pathways' position was correct. In one case of a meningioma, according to {PTV}, the tumor was falsely localized postcentrally. In the case of a precentral cavernoma, no motor response could be elicited by cortical stimulation. {CONCLUSION} Intraoperative {PTV} on the basis of {ADW} provides the neurosurgeon with reliable information concerning the position of the principal motor pathways during intracranial procedures as proved with intraoperative electrophysiological testing. The technique has the potential to reduce operative morbidity. {PTV} is straightforward and can be adapted to other customized neuronavigation devices.},

As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)}, diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional {MRI}, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. {DTI} has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind {DTI} and to present potential applications.},

Early in apoptosis, cytochrome c translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum where it selectively binds {InsP(3)R}, resulting in sustained, oscillatory cytosolic calcium increases. These calcium events are linked to the coordinate release of cytochrome c from all mitochondria.

Varisolve bubbles (0.20 0.02 {nL;} n = 2 and 0.53 0.27 {nL;} n = 27 for the two gas compositions) entered but either did not lodge or cleared within seconds.

{{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="CONCLUSIONS"} {NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{\textgreater}Both} Varisolve formulations produced smaller embolism bubbles than occurred with air-based microfoam. Rapid clearance of Varisolve bubbles suggests that they are so small that they do not have adequate surface area available for significant binding interactions with arteriolar endothelium. Larger air-based bubbles obstruct arteriolar vessels and block blood {flow.{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}}},

	abstract = {Several properties of the cerebral cortex, including its columnar and laminar organization, as well as the topographic organization of cortical areas, can only be properly understood in the context of the intrinsic two-dimensional structure of the cortical surface. In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper. These procedures allow for the routine use of cortical surface-based analysis and visualization methods in functional brain imaging.},

	abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}This} paper presents a novel fuzzy-segmentation method for diffusion tensor {(DT)} and magnetic resonance {(MR)} images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means {(FCM)}, incorporate Gaussian class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in Riemannian spaces. Unlike {FCM-based} schemes, the proposed method represents these manifolds using nonparametric data-driven statistical models. The paper describes a statistically-sound (consistent) technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian {DT} spaces. The proposed method produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework. Results on synthetic and real, {DT} and {MR} images, show that the proposed method provides information about the uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity. By enhancing the nonparametric model to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle, we exploit the framework to extract the cingulum fiber bundle. Typical tractography methods for tract delineation, incorporating thresholds on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking, can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise. For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts with sharp changes in orientation, such as the cingulum. The results demonstrate that the proposed method extracts this structure significantly more accurately as compared to tractography.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We present here our preliminary validation of tractography in human subjects harboring brain tumors by comparing the results produced by neuronavigation and electrical white matter stimulation in two patients with gliomas in the eloquent area. Although we were able to visualize the pyramidal tract with the fiber-tracking technique, the images failed to present the actual size of the fiber bundles.
